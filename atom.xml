    <id>http://www.learningipadprogramming.com/2012/07/26/class-declaration-versus-class-definition</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A reader sent me an outstanding question. He pointed out that in chapter 4 of Learning iPad Programming, I wrote:</p>

<p>&#8220;To define a class you use @interface. In Listing 4.2, the CoinTosser class definition starts with the line @interface CoinTosser : NSObject. @interface is Objective-C syntax that tells the compiler that what follows is a class definition. CoinTosser is the name of the class. The colon character separates the class name from the name of the superclass. The new class inherits properties and methods from the superclass. The class definition starts with @interface and ends at the first occurrence of @end. This tells the compiler it has reached the end of the class definition.&#8221;</p>

<p>The reader asked, &#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t class definition be class declaration?&#8221; It turns out, class definition is correct.</p>

<p>While many programmers might use declaration and definition interchangeability, there are subtle differences in C and C++. And since Objective-C is a superset of C, those subtle differences apply.</p>

<p>A class <strong>declaration</strong> tells the compiler that a class exists. A class <strong>definition</strong> tells the compiler all the needed information to create an instance of the class. It tells the compiler about its member functions, properties, and so on. With Objective-C, the difference between class declaration and definition can be seen in the syntax.</p>

<p><code>@class className</code> declares a class, so it&#8217;s a class declaration. It tells the compiler the name of a class. This is also known as a &#8220;forward declaration.&#8221;</p>

<p><code>@interface className</code> and its contents defines the class, so it&#8217;s a class definition. It tells the compiler all it needs to know about the class, how to create an instance, what properties and methods are contained in the class, and so on.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of additional links that explain the differences as seen in C and C++:</p>

    <id>http://www.learningipadprogramming.com/2012/06/06/my-appsterdam-visit</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks ago I had the pleasure of visiting Amsterdam with my family. Amsterdam is a beautiful city with great restaurants and super friendly people. Getting around Amsterdam is really easy. We walked most of the time, but found the trains to be convenient when we wanted to return to the hotel quickly.</p>
<img alt='Appsterdam logo smaller' style='float:left' width='125' height='96' src='http://learnipadprogramming.com/files/2012/06/appsterdam-logo-smaller.png' border='0' /><a href='http://mur.mu.rs/?p=196'>What is Appsterdam</a>
<p>As luck would have it, I had an opportunity to speak at one of the Appsterdam luncheons, and I attended a social gathering later that evening. This gave me a chance to meeting many of the local Appsterdamers, which to my surprise are from all over the world. In fact, I met a number of Americans who now call Amsterdam home. Meeting this international group of app makers proved to me that Amsterdam is not only a great place to live, it&#8217;s a great place to run an indie software company. And if it wasn&#8217;t for my love and desire to live in a ski town, I might try to convenience my wife we need to move there. While moving there is not an option for us, extended stays most certainly are, and I hope to make it happen (hint, hint to my wife).</p>

<p>While traveling abroad is not easy for everyone - the airfare alone can be costly - there is a way to get a taste of Appsterdam right here in the States. In San Francisco during next week&#8217;s WWDC, Appsterdam will be hosting the <a href='http://www.robelkin.com/wwdc/'>Appsterdam WWDC HQ</a>, a free, week long co-working space (June 11 through 15) and daily talks from <a href='http://www.robelkin.com/wwdc/speakers.html'>outstanding speakers</a>. Appsterdam WWDC HQ is open to all. A WWDC badge is not required.</p>

<p>If you are in SF during WWDC, with or without a badge, I encourage you to stop by <a href='http://www.robelkin.com/wwdc/'>Appterdam WWDC HQ</a> and get a taste for what this organization and movement has to offer app markers.</p>]]></content>

    <link href="http://www.learningipadprogramming.com/2012/04/03/how-to-ignore-performselector-leak-warning/"/>
    <published>2012-04-03T00:00:00-04:00</published>
    <updated>2012-04-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.learningipadprogramming.com/2012/04/03/how-to-ignore-performselector-leak-warning</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In Listing 16.22 from the Learning iPad Programming book, I show how to invoke a method using -performSelector: where the selector is determined at runtime from a set of names stored in an NSArray. The implementation in Listing 16.22 could have been done a number of different ways, but I chose this approach to show how to set and perform a selector at runtime. However, the code produces a compiler warning message when ARC is used.</p>

<p>Because ARC is used and the selector is determined at run, the compiler generates a &#8220;possible memory leak&#8221; warning message. This warning is legitimate given that the selector is unknown at compile time and ARC is being used to manage memory.</p>

<p>At the time the code in Listing 16.22 was written, there was no way to ignore this warning message. That can be a good thing since explicitly ignoring a warning message from the compiler can be a bad thing. 99.9% of the time you want to fix or refactor your code so the warning message goes away. However, there are times when you know more than the compiler does, and the code in Listing 16.22 is one of those rare times.</p>

<p>In this particular case, each selector that can potentially be called will not cause a memory leak because each one returns a void. The compiler doesn&#8217;t know this, but you (as the programmer) know this to be true. So this warning message can safely be ignored. But how do you tell the compiler to ignore the -performSelector possible memory leak warning so you don&#8217;t have to see the warning message each time you compile the project?</p>

<p>You can use tell clang to ignore the -performSelector leak warning by wrapping the -performSelector: call with a set of #pragma statements that temporarily ignore the warning for the code included in the block. Here is an example:</p>

<p><span>objc</span></p>

<h1 id='pragma_clang_diagnostic_push'>pragma clang diagnostic push</h1>

<h1 id='pragma_clang_diagnostic_ignored_warcperformselectorleaks'>pragma clang diagnostic ignored &#34;-Warc-performSelector-leaks&#34;</h1>

<p><span>self performSelector:selector</span>;</p>

<h1 id='pragma_clang_diagnostic_pop'>pragma clang diagnostic pop</h1>

<p><span>/objc</span></p>

<p>So the code causing the warning message in Listing 16.22 for the PhotoWheel app now looks like this:</p>

<p><span>objc highlight=&#8221;22,23-25&#8221;</span> - (void)actionSheet:(UIActionSheet <em>)actionSheet clickedButtonAtIndex:(NSInteger)buttonIndex { // Do nothing if the user taps outside the action // sheet (thus closing the popover containing the // action sheet). if (buttonIndex &#60; 0) { return; }</em></p>

<p>NSMutableArray <em>names = <span><span>NSMutableArray alloc</span> init</span>;</em></p>

<p>if (<span>actionSheet tag</span> == 0) { <span>names addObject:@&#34;confirmDeletePhotoAlbum&#34;</span>;</p>

<p>} else { BOOL hasCamera = <span>UIImagePickerController isSourceTypeAvailable:UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeCamera</span>; if (hasCamera) <span>names addObject:@&#34;presentCamera&#34;</span>; <span>names addObject:@&#34;presentPhotoLibrary&#34;</span>; }</p>

<p>SEL selector = NSSelectorFromString(<span>names objectAtIndex:buttonIndex</span>);</p>

<h1 id='pragma_clang_diagnostic_push'>pragma clang diagnostic push</h1>

<h1 id='pragma_clang_diagnostic_ignored_warcperformselectorleaks'>pragma clang diagnostic ignored &#34;-Warc-performSelector-leaks&#34;</h1>

<p><span>self performSelector:selector</span>;</p>

<h1 id='pragma_clang_diagnostic_pop'>pragma clang diagnostic pop</h1>

<p>} <span>/objc</span></p>]]></content>

    <updated>2012-03-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.learningipadprogramming.com/2012/03/24/using-xcode-4-2-on-snow-leopard</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few people have recently mentioned to me that they are still running Snow Leopard (Mac OS X 10.6). The latest version of Xcode requires Lion (Mac OS X 10.7), however, Xcode 4.2 for Snow Leopard is still available for download from the Apple web site.</p>

<p>Learning iPad Programming was written based on Xcode 4.2, so everything covered in the book, with one exception, works with Xcode 4.2 on Snow Leopard. The one exception is the &#8220;Allows External Storage&#8221; flag in Core Data. This flag is discussed in Chapter 13 on Page 308, and the flag requires Lion. Compile errors are generated if you set this flag while running on Snow Leopard. Not to worry. You can still build the app without setting this flag. The app, after all, is a sample app so for the purpose of learning it is okay to not use this flag when using Xcode 4.2 on Snow Leopard.</p>

<p>To download Xcode 4.2 for Snow Leopard, go to <a href='https://developer.apple.com/downloads/'>https://developer.apple.com/downloads/</a> and sign in with your Apple Developer ID. In the search box, type &#8220;Xcode 4.2&#8221;. The search results will show Xcode 4.2 for Snow Leopard (see the screenshot below). Use this version of Xcode if you are still running on Snow Leopard. <img alt='Downloads' width='600' height='458' src='http://learnipadprogramming.com/files/2012/03/Downloads.png' border='0' /></p>

<p>As an alternative, you can sign into the <a href='https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/'>iOS Dev Center</a> and scroll down to the Downloads area to find the download link to Xcode 4.2 for Snow Leopard. <img alt='IOS Dev Center  Apple Developer' width='600' height='480' src='http://learnipadprogramming.com/files/2012/03/iOS-Dev-Center-Apple-Developer.png' border='0' /></p>]]></content>

    <updated>2012-03-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.learningipadprogramming.com/2012/03/24/is-there-an-issue-with-the-print-version</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Learning iPad Programming has received two negative reviews on Amazon, both concerning the print quality of the book. I&#8217;ve received a number of inquires because of these two reviews, so I decided to make a blog posting.</p>
<strong>In short, there is nothing wrong with the print quality of the book.</strong>
<p>That said, I would like to address the concerns mentioned in the two reviews, which are available <a href='http://www.amazon.com/review/R19TKCFJHSKQUW/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0321750403&amp;nodeID=&amp;tag=&amp;linkCode='>here</a> and <a href='http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XCRENVK65S89/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0321750403&amp;nodeID=&amp;tag=&amp;linkCode='>here</a>.</p>
<h2>Responding to the Reviews</h2>
<p>The first review says, &#8220;This print version uses very small fonts, the figures are poor black/grey/white renderings of color images, and the paper is thin enough that the other side of the page is faintly visible.&#8221; Let me address each point.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very small fonts.&#8221; I disagree with this. The font size is the same size found in many other programming books including those from Addison Wesley.</p>

<p>&#8220;The figures are poor black/grey/white renderings of color images.&#8221; It is true that figure images are greyscale version of color images. The images are screenshots taken from my MacBook Pro and iPad, which means the images were originally color. But the greyscale rendering of the images is on par with other print books that I have compared. I guess it could be a matter of personal preference, but I have no issue with the quality of the greyscale images. That said, I wish the figure images were printed in full color, but that would only raise the cost of the book without providing additional value.</p>

<p>&#8220;The paper is thin enough that the other side of the page is faintly visible.&#8221; This is true, and it&#8217;s my one and only complaint about the print book. The paper stock is a little thin. The issue has been brought to the publisher&#8217;s attention, and they plan to use a thicker paper stock in the future. When that will happen is something I don&#8217;t know, but I have been told future printings will use thicker paper stock. (As of this writing, there have been two printings of the book, both using the thinner paper stock.)</p>

<p>As for being able to see print from the other side, yes, this is true, but it is faint and I only notice it in white space areas. It does not district me from reading the book, but <a href='http://netforbeginners.about.com/od/xyz/f/What-Is-YMMV.htm'>YMMV</a>. I&#8217;ll also point out that a number of other print books do the same. For example, while comparing my book to <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321535022/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whitepeaksoft-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321535022'>Cocoa Design Patterns</a>, I noticed print from the other side is slightly visible and it uses a slightly thicker paper stock. In my opinion, this is something that happens when black ink is printed on most white paper stock. I even notice this on printouts from my home printer using standard quality inkjet paper stock.</p>

<p>The second review has this to say, &#8220;I became more and more frustrated with trying to read the small type printed in ink so light that it looked as if the printing press had run out of ink. The code listing font is even more difficult to read.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again, the font size is the same size found in many other books from Addison Wesley, and the code listings use the some font size. The only difference is the font style. A monospace font is used for the source code listing.</p>

<p>The light ink that &#8220;looked as if the printing press has run out of ink&#8221;, well, all I can say is it is possible that the reviewer did receive a defective book. However, I have reviewed 35 print versions from the first printing, and I did not find a single book with the issue of light ink. Again, it&#8217;s possible the individual received a defective book, but defective books are not common.</p>

<p>So is there a problem with the print version of Learning iPad Programming? Absolutely not. The paper stock is thin, and I wish that was not the case, but it does not, in my opinion, take away from the readability of the book. As for the font size, quality of figure images, etc, well, that&#8217;s probably a matter of preference.</p>
<h2>How to Decide</h2>
<p>How can you decide if the print quality is suitable for you? Here are some options for you:</p>

<p>1) Visit a brick and mortar book store and flip through the pages yourself. I know this is not an option for everyone especially those living outside the U.S., but for those living nearing a Barnes and Noble, stop by the store and compare the print quality to that of other programming books. I&#8217;m sure you will see little to no difference.</p>

<p>2) Take a look at this <a href='http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780321750402/samplepages/0321750403.pdf'>sample PDF</a>. While not exactly the same as having a printed copy of the book in your hands, you can see what fonts are used, font sizes, the quality of the figure images, and so on. It is the best representation of the print book without holding the actual book in your hands.</p>

<p>3) Take a look at the photos posted below. These are photographs of random pages from the book. I&#8217;m no photographer, so the pictures could be a little better - a lot better in fact - but as you can see the font size and print quality are very readable.</p>

<p>4) Buy the ebook edition. The book is available in the <a href='http://amzn.to/ipadprogbook-kindle'>Kindle Book Store</a>, iBooks Store, and from <a href='http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321750403'>informIT.com</a> as PDF and epub. This option also saves trees, and it has become my prefer way to purchase new books.</p>

<p>Compare the <a href='http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780321750402/samplepages/0321750403.pdf'>sample PDF</a> and photos below then decide for yourself if the print version is suitable for you. And if by chance you happen to receive a deflective book then let me know. Send me specific page numbers, and I can request a warehouse inspection. Or send me the book, and I&#8217;ll make sure you receive a good copy.</p>
<h2>All Feedback is Good Feedback</h2>
<p>One last point to make. In no way am I saying the two individuals should not have posted the reviews. On the contrary, all feedback, good and bad, is welcome. All feedback is good feedback in my opinion. And if these individuals had not posted the reviews then the publisher would not have agreed to use a thicker paper stock in the future. So post your review, good or bad, to Amazon. It will help make this book and others that much better.</p>

<p>For those who purchased the Kindle or iBooks version back before they were pulled…I purchased the Kindle and iBooks versions when they were first released at the beginning of December. I was able to update my iBooks version the other day by deleting the book from my device and re-downloading it. Updating the Kindle version is more involved. It requires Amazon to send you an email asking if you wish to update. Amazon does this because installing an update will overwrite your highlights and bookmarks for the book being updated. So far, I have not received my email from Amazon informing me of the update and giving me the option to update. I hope it comes soon because I want to see the latest and greatest on my Kindle.</p>

<p>Update: I found that emailing Amazon at <a href='mailto:kindle-feedback@amazon.com'>kindle-feedback@amazon.com</a> and requesting the latest version is the quickest way to get the updated Kindle version pushed out to your device.</p>]]></content>

    <id>http://www.learningipadprogramming.com/2011/12/10/kindle-and-ibooks-versions-are-available</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href='http://amzn.to/ipadprogbook-kindle'>Kindle</a> and iBooks Store versions of Learning iPad Programming are now available for purchase and download. This is exciting but at the same time a little disappointing for me. Why? I&#8217;m not happy with some of the formatting errors found in the digital version of the book. The two most obvious formatting errors are shortcut keys and source code listings.</p>

<p>Something strange happened with the shortcut keys. Tom and I were asked to use the Command symbol (⌘) instead of typing the word Command. For example, Option-⌘-4 instead of Command-Option-4 (which was my style before writing this book). Two things happened with the Command symbol. First, in cases were it is displayed in the epub version of the book, the symbol floats up high. In the Kindle version, the symbol appears on its own line. But worse than this is when the letter &#8220;c&#8221; is displayed in place of the Command symbol.</p>

<p>Chapter 2 is the worse hit chapter with regard to the &#8220;c&#8221; problem, as I know call it. So instead of seeing Option-⌘-4 you see Option-c-4. These two keystroke sequences are completely different, and trust me, Tom and I did not type in Option-c-4 in the manuscript. We used the Command symbol, but unfortunately something strange happened when the digital versions of the book were made.</p>

<p>The other problem is with source code listings. The source code listings were formatted for print, not for the digital version of the book. I use the line wrapping option in Xcode to dynamically format my source code based on the size of the Workspace window. When I copied the code into the manuscript, I again let line wrapping do its thing. But during the copy editor phase, we were asked to reformat the code listings to 80 columns per line. We did this and the code listings should look good in the print version of the book. However, the 80 column format in the ebook version doesn&#8217;t work. Lines are wrapped at odd places making the source code listings more difficult to read. I believe this would not have been a problem if we left the lines of code as is and let line wrapping do its normal thing.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m exciting that the book is now available (at least in digital format), but I&#8217;m also not happy about these two formatting issues.</p>

<p>To those of you who have (or will) buy a digital copy of the book, I apologize for the formatting issues with shortcut keys and source code listings. I have made the publisher aware of the issues, and I can only hope that a &#8220;fix&#8221; can be made. (This is my first book, and my first book with this publisher, so I&#8217;m not sure what can and cannot be done with regard to fixing the formatting problems.)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In Chapter 9 of the book, I talk about an uncaught exception that will crash the app. Figure 9.4 shows the uncaught exception and the line of code that caused the exception. What I failed to mention is that you might need to set a breakpoint on all exceptions to see the offending line of code. If, for example, Xcode is highlight a line of code in main.m then you need to set a breakpoint on all exceptions.</p>

<p>To set a breakpoint on all exceptions, go to the Breakpoint navigator and click the + button found in the lower left corner. You can set the breakpoint for All, Objective-C, or C++ exceptions. You can also set the break option to On Throw or On Catch. The default settings (All exceptions and On Throw) is all you need to see the offending line of code.</p>

Unfortunately the chapter on writing a universal app was dropped from the book. There just wasn&#8217;t enough room after writing nearly 800 pages. So this short video will have to do for now.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>InformIT asked me to record a few video podcasts about our book Learning iPad Programming. A lot has changed since the videos were recorded. Tom has come on as a co-author, and the book was updated to focus on iOS 5. But the videos still give a good sense of what you will learn while reading the book.</p>

<p>That said, here is the <a href='http://www.informit.com/podcasts/episode.aspx?e=f8790bd2-d66d-49c6-a8ec-eb0788ca6c89'>first video</a>. I will post another video in a few days.</p>

<p>Yep, the manuscript is complete. A part of me thought this day would never come. But it&#8217;s here and I couldn&#8217;t be happier. Tom and I will be doing some edits over the next few weeks then the book heads off to the printers.</p>

<p>With the writing part finally out of the way, I can turn my attention to this web site. I have a number of how to blog posts queued up that will expand on the book. Stay tune. The best is yet to come.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been working so hard on completing the book that I forgot to officially welcome Tom Harrington as co-author of Learning iPad Programming.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve known Tom for a couple of years now. Our paths have crossed multiple times at conferences and on client projects. At WWDC this year, I accepted the reality that I cannot complete the book this summer without some help. Tom quickly came to mind as someone perfect to co-author the book with me. I already had a sense of what it&#8217;s like working with Tom, but even better than that, Tom is already a published author. He has co-authored two other iOS related books: <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430224037/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whitepeaksoft-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=1430224037'>iPhone Advanced Projects</a><img alt='' style='border:none !important;margin:0px !important' width='1' height='1' src='http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1430224037&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369' border='0' /> and most recently <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321670426/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whitepeaksoft-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0321670426'>Core Data for iOS: Developing Data-Driven Applications for the iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch</a><img alt='' style='border:none !important;margin:0px !important' width='1' height='1' src='http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321670426&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369' border='0' />.</p>

<p>Words can&#8217;t express my gratitude towards Tom for stepping up and helping me complete the book. Tom and I have already been working together on the book for the last couple of months, and the manuscript is nearly complete.</p>

<p>Thanks Tom, and welcome aboard!</p>]]></content>

<p>VTM is a great opportunity for iOS developers to gather, network, and learn from one another. As expected with VTM, the speaker list is outstanding and I’m honored to be included among those speaking this weekend.</p>

<p>New to VTM is the one-day workshop on Friday. I for one am looking forward to getting hands on with Cocos2D in the intro to game programming workshop taught by Rod Strougo and Ray Wenderlich.</p>

<p>Tickets are still available for the conference. You can also get an additional $100 off with the discount code SEASPK2. So what are you waiting for? <a href='http://www.voicesthatmatter.com/iphonespring2011/register.aspx'>Register now</a> and see you in Seattle.</p>]]></content>

    <id>http://www.learningipadprogramming.com/2011/02/22/getting-started-what-to-read</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I setup this site at the end of December, my plan was to make at least one blog posting a week. As you can see that didn&#8217;t happen. I let myself become overwhelmed over the last two months but things are finally settling down&#8230;I hope. And I hope to have more time going forward to make regular posting here.</p>

<p>Okay, on to my main topic&#8230;getting started and what to read&#8230;</p>

<p>A few people have asked me for recommended reading on getting started with iOS program. Of course I would like to say, &#8220;Read my book,&#8221; but it&#8217;s not ready yet. So I asked myself, &#8220;What would I read if I were getting started today?&#8221;</p>

<p>If I were getting started today, I would start by reading Aaron Hillagass&#8217;s <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321706242?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whitepeaksoft-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321706242'>iPhone Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide</a><img alt='' style='border:none !important;margin:0px !important' width='1' height='1' src='http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=whitepeaksoft-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321706242' border='0' />. It is well written, and it covers everything you need to get started with iPhone programming.</p>

<p>The other book I would read right away if I were starting out today is Robert Clair&#8217;s <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321711386?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whitepeaksoft-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321711386'>Learning Objective-C 2.0</a><img alt='' style='border:none !important;margin:0px !important' width='1' height='1' src='http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=whitepeaksoft-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321711386' border='0' />. I like his writing style and I found his book to be very informative. Another good Objective-C book is Stephan Kochan&#8217;s <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321566157?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whitepeaksoft-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321566157'>Programming in Objective-C 2.0</a><img alt='' style='border:none !important;margin:0px !important' width='1' height='1' src='http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=whitepeaksoft-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321566157' border='0' />, which was, in fact, the first book I read when I decided to learn Objective-C and Cocoa.</p>

<p>So there you have it. Those are the books I would read if I were getting started today.</p>]]></content>
