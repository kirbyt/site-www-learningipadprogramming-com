Welcome to my new blog site on learning iPad programming. My name is Kirby Turner and I am your host. I've been programming professionally for more years than I care to count. I've been doing Cocoa development since 2007, and iOS development since the first SDK beta in 2008.

Earlier this year I was approached by Chuck Toporek, aka [@chuckdude](http://twitter.com/chuckdude), to write a book on iPad programming. Writing a programming book has long been a goal of mine, so I couldn't pass up this exciting opportunity. I accepted Chuck's offer and my life will never be the same. 

I knew writing a book would be hard. I just didn't know it would be really, really hard. But with support from my wife, Chuck, and other friends, I will see this through. 

I'm making progress on the book, with 6 chapters completed and 3 more in the works. I decided now is a good time to setup this website to talk more openly about the book, my progress on it, and to share tips on learning iPad programming as I write the book. My hope is to make at least one blog posting a week. We'll see how that pans out.

Meanwhile, feel free to [contact me](http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/contact) if you have questions about the book or have suggestions on specific topics to cover in the book or here on the site.
