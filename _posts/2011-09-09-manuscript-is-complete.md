This morning I made a <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/kirbyt/status/112092725574242304">tweet</a> that I've being waiting to do for a verify long time.

Yep, the manuscript is complete. A part of me thought this day would never come. But it's here and I couldn't be happier. Tom and I will be doing some edits over the next few weeks then the book heads off to the printers. 

With the writing part finally out of the way, I can turn my attention to this web site. I have a number of how to blog posts queued up that will expand on the book. Stay tune. The best is yet to come.
