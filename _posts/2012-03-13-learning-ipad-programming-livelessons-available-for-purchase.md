I learned today that the <a href="http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321821661">Learning iPad Programming LiveLessons</a> videos are available for purchase from the <a href="http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321821661">InformIT web site</a>. So you don't need a Safari Books Online account to purchase and enjoy these training videos.
