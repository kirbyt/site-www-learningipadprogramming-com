The Kindle and iBooks versions of the book have been pulled from the stores while the publisher fixes the content format issues. Once the issues have been fixed, the books will once again be available for purchase.

Also, I've been told that those who have already purchased the ebook will have the option to upgrade to the corrected version.

I'm very sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused.
