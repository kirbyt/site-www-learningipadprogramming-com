InformIT asked me to record a few video podcasts about our book Learning iPad Programming. A lot has changed since the videos were recorded. Tom has come on as a co-author, and the book was updated to focus on iOS 5. But the videos still give a good sense of what you will learn while reading the book.

That said, here is the [first video][1]. I will post another video in a few days.
