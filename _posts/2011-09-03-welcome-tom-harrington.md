I have been working so hard on completing the book that I forgot to officially welcome Tom Harrington as co-author of Learning iPad Programming. 

I've known Tom for a couple of years now. Our paths have crossed multiple times at conferences and on client projects. At WWDC this year, I accepted the reality that I cannot complete the book this summer without some help. Tom quickly came to mind as someone perfect to co-author the book with me. I already had a sense of what it's like working with Tom, but even better than that, Tom is already a published author. He has co-authored two other iOS related books: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430224037/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whitepeaksoft-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=1430224037">iPhone Advanced Projects</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1430224037&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important;margin:0px !important" /> and most recently <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321670426/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whitepeaksoft-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0321670426">Core Data for iOS: Developing Data-Driven Applications for the iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321670426&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important;margin:0px !important" />.

Words can't express my gratitude towards Tom for stepping up and helping me complete the book. Tom and I have already been working together on the book for the last couple of months, and the manuscript is nearly complete. 

Thanks Tom, and welcome aboard!
