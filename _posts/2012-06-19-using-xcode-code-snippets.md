Have you tried Xcode code snippets? If not, head over to InformIT.com to read an article I wrote on being more [productive using Xcode code snippets](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1914191). 

Speaking of Xcode code snippets, Cocoaholic has released a Mac app called [Snippet Edit](http://cocoaholic.com/snippet_edit/) that makes it possible to edit your code snippets as well as the standard ones without using Xcode. I haven't tried the app yet, but it does look interesting.
