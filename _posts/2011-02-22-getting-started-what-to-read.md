When I setup this site at the end of December, my plan was to make at least one blog posting a week. As you can see that didn't happen. I let myself become overwhelmed over the last two months but things are finally settling down...I hope. And I hope to have more time going forward to make regular posting here. 

Okay, on to my main topic...getting started and what to read...

A few people have asked me for recommended reading on getting started with iOS program. Of course I would like to say, "Read my book," but it's not ready yet. So I asked myself, "What would I read if I were getting started today?"

If I were getting started today, I would start by reading Aaron Hillagass's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321706242?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whitepeaksoft-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321706242">iPhone Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=whitepeaksoft-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321706242" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important;margin:0px !important" />. It is well written, and it covers everything you need to get started with iPhone programming. 

The other book I would read right away if I were starting out today is Robert Clair's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321711386?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whitepeaksoft-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321711386">Learning Objective-C 2.0</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=whitepeaksoft-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321711386" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important;margin:0px !important" />. I like his writing style and I found his book to be very informative. Another good Objective-C book is Stephan Kochan's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321566157?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whitepeaksoft-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321566157">Programming in Objective-C 2.0</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=whitepeaksoft-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321566157" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important;margin:0px !important" />, which was, in fact, the first book I read when I decided to learn Objective-C and Cocoa.

So there you have it. Those are the books I would read if I were getting started today.
