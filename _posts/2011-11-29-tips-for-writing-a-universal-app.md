Here's another video that was recorded earlier this year. In this video I share some <a href="http://www.informit.com/podcasts/episode.aspx?e=ba19d517-6470-438d-a1a4-290f26b8681c">tips for writing a universal app</a>. Unfortunately the chapter on writing a universal app was dropped from the book. There just wasn't enough room after writing nearly 800 pages. So this short video will have to do for now.
