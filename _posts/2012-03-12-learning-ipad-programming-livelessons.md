The results of that week are now available at Safari Books Online. It's the <a href="http://bit.ly/ipadlivelessons">Learning iPad Programming LiveLessons</a>, a series of videos teaching you how to build apps for the iPad. The LiveLessons include over 8 hours of video based on the book Learning iPad Programming. 

I should mention not all topics found in the book are covered in the LiveLessons. There simply wasn't enough time to cover everything. Besides, covering everything may have resulted in 20 hours of videos instead of the 8 and half hours available today. Still, if you are new to iPad programming, and you are looking for an alternative way to learn iPad programming then check out <a href="http://bit.ly/ipadlivelessons">Learning iPad Programming LiveLessons</a>.

Attention iPad users with a Safari Books Online account: You can watch the Learning iPad Programming LiveLessons from your iPad using the <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=joxFicmfXq8&amp;subid=&amp;offerid=146261.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=3909&amp;RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fsafari-to-go%2Fid385824712%3Fmt%3D8">Safari To Go</a> iPad app.
